In this paper, we disucss the concurrency pattern changed from callback, promise/future, to async/await and channel. Many program languages supoort these patterns partially or fully. We will study them from an evolutionary perspective.

Parttern | Language
-------- | --------
CallBack | C++
Promise/future | Javascript
Async/await | C#
Channel | Go

# Callback
Before talked about callback, give an example about push/pull. In some extent, callback is push.
```C++
// main thread
auto result = sendTasktoWorkThread(task); // execute in other thread
doOtherthing();
auto value = result.get(); // [pull the result]
doRemainedthing(value);
```

```C++
// when task done, call callback in worker thread directly
// or send event to main thread which execute call callback then [push the result]
sendTasktoWorkThread(task, callback); 
doOtherthing();
eventloop();
```

What if register many callbacks nestedly?
```c++
#include <iostream>

#define DEFINE_STEP_N(n) \
template <typename F> \
void step##n(F f) { \
    std::cout << n << std::endl; \
    f(); \
}

DEFINE_STEP_N(1)
DEFINE_STEP_N(2)
DEFINE_STEP_N(3)
DEFINE_STEP_N(4)
DEFINE_STEP_N(5)

void fun() {
    std::cout << "last" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
   step1([]{
        step2([]{
            step3([]{
                step4([] {
                    step5(fun);
                });
            });
        });
   });
}

// output
1
2
3
4
5
last 
```
## Prons and cons:
- Callback hell as previous example show: 
  it's really counter-intuitive thing to register callback.
- Lifecyle manage: 
  need keep the object involved in callback not destructed before call in lanugage not supporting garbage collect. Refer to [Lifetime Safety By Default](https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2016/blob/master/Presentations/Lifetime%20Safety%20By%20Default%20-%20Making%20Code%20Leak-Free%20by%20Construction/Lifetime%20Safety%20By%20Default%20-%20Making%20Code%20Leak-Free%20by%20Construction%20-%20Herb%20Sutter%20-%20CppCon%202016.pdf) for more details.
- Context schedule:
  schedule the callback in original context, or in current worker context. If run in current worker context, should have additional mutex to avoid data race in the callback.
  
# Promise/future
Here is an example from Javascript.
```html
<html>
<head> 
<script>
function taskA() {
    console.log("Task A");
    throw new Error("throw Error Task A")
}
function taskB() {
    console.log("Task B");
}
function onRejected(error) {
    console.log("Catch Error: ", error);
}
function finalTask() {
    console.log("Final Task");
    throw new Error("throw Error Final task")
}

var promiseB = new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(new Error('error msg')))
promiseB
.then(success => console.log('onfulfilled ', success), err => console.log('onRejected ', err))
.then(taskA)
.then(taskB)
.catch(onRejected)
.then(finalTask);
</script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```
C++ has a standard implement, and Facebook also has a implement [folly/futures](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/futures/Future.h).  
Here is an [example](https://www.oschina.net/translate/futures-for-c-11-at-facebook).
![folly/future](https://github.com/pzhp/pzhp.github.io/blob/master/images/promise_future.png) 

## Pros and cons:
- Simplify the process on register then functions, easily chain then functions.
- Simplify the communication between main thread and worker thread. Promise set value/exception, future get value/exception.
- When then functions need multi arguments, it's hard to write, as follow example:

```javascript
function takeLongTime(n) {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
        // setTimeout mock time consuming task.
        // after n, will call the funtion
        setTimeout(() => resolve(n + 200), n);
    });
}

function step1(n) {
    console.log(`step1 with ${n}`);
    return takeLongTime(n);
}

function step2(n) {
    console.log(`step2 with ${n}`);
    return takeLongTime(n);
}

function step3(n) {
    console.log(`step3 with ${n}`);
    return takeLongTime(n);
}

// serialize execute: step1 => step2 => step3 
function doIt() {
    console.time("doIt");
    const time1 = 600;
    step1(time1)
        .then(time2 => step2(time2))
        .then(time3 => step3(time3))
        .then(result => {
            console.log(`result is ${result}`);
            console.timeEnd("doIt");
        });
}

doIt();
```

# Async/await
- Async/await pattern comes from C# [Async and Await](https://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html). 
- Javascript ES7 support it [javascript promise and async/await](https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000007535316). 
- C++ has a [proposal](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/N3858.pdf).

Here is just a summary from [Async and Await](https://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html).

The beginning of an async method is executed just like any other method. That is, it runs synchronously until it hits an “await” (or throws an exception).If “await” sees that the awaitable has not completed, then it acts asynchronously. It tells the awaitable to run the remainder of the method when it completes, and then returns from the async method.Later on, when the awaitable completes, it will execute the remainder of the async method. If you’re awaiting a built-in awaitable (such as a task), then the remainder of the async method will execute on a “context” that was captured before the “await” returned.

``` C#
public async Task DoSomethingAsync()
{
  // think of “await” as an “asynchronous wait”. wait until the awaitbale function has a result.
  await Task.Delay(100);
  // remained code is executed in the captured context before the “await” returned.
}
```
Note:
Await can apply to any awaitable type like Task<T> in C#, not only async function
**Context**

>In the overview, I mentioned that when you await a built-in awaitable, then the awaitable will capture the current “context” and later >apply it to the remainder of the async method. What exactly is that “context”?
>Simple answer:
>
>If you’re on a UI thread, then it’s a UI context.
>If you’re responding to an ASP.NET request, then it’s an ASP.NET request context.
>Otherwise, it’s usually a thread pool context.
>Complex answer:
>
>If SynchronizationContext.Current is not null, then it’s the current SynchronizationContext. (UI and ASP.NET request contexts are >SynchronizationContext contexts).
>Otherwise, it’s the current TaskScheduler (TaskScheduler.Default is the thread pool context).
```C#
// WinForms example (it works exactly the same for WPF).
private async void DownloadFileButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
  // Since we asynchronously wait, the UI thread is not blocked by the file download.
  await DownloadFileAsync(fileNameTextBox.Text);

  // Since we resume on the UI context, we can directly access UI elements.
  resultTextBox.Text = "File downloaded!";
}

private async Task DownloadFileAsync(string fileName)
{
  // Use HttpClient or whatever to download the file contents.
  var fileContents = await DownloadFileContentsAsync(fileName).ConfigureAwait(false);

  // Note that because of the ConfigureAwait(false), we are not on the original context here.
  // Instead, we're running on the thread pool.

  // Write the file contents out to a disk file.
  await WriteToDiskAsync(fileName, fileContents).ConfigureAwait(false);

  // The second call to ConfigureAwait(false) is not *required*, but it is Good Practice.
}
```
## Prons and cons
- Use sync logic to write async code
- The continuation is scheduled on specific context.

# Sender&receiver: unified executor
	
[C++ Executors](https://mysteriouspreserve.com/blog/2021/11/12/A-Brief-Talk-About-The-Cpp-Executors/)
	
	- Sender construct: more like **DAG**
	- Run task in GPU or remote system
	
# Channel

>Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.
>
>--Effective Go

``` Go
package main
import "fmt"
import "time"

func main() {
    c1 := make(chan string)
    go func() {
        c1 <- "ping from 1"
    }()

    c2 := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        c2 <- 2
    }()

    // time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    // case is chosen randomly
    for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
        select {
        case msg1 := <-c1:
            fmt.Println(msg1)
        case msg2 := <-c2:
            fmt.Println(msg2)
        case <-time.After(time.Second * 30):
            fmt.Println("timeOut")
            // default: // if no default, block
            //  fmt.Println("non block")
        }
    }
}
```
You can treat channel as linux pipeline. 
Another system language [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) also support message passing style concurrency.
```Rust ++
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        let val = String::from("hi");
        tx.send(val).unwrap();
    });

    let received = rx.recv().unwrap();
    println!("Got: {}", received);
}
```

Here is C++ example to re-write above example.
``` C++
// consider use c++11 implement previous code
std::future<std::string> f = std::async(std::launch::async, []() { 
	return dotask();
	})
std::string ret = f.get(); // block
// f.wait_for(); // support time out
```
C++ future only support set value once, but channel support tranfer data like a stream.
